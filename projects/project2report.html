      <h2>Proposition: The average investigation length of NYPD complaints are longer for certain ethnicities, such as Black and Hispanic.</h2>

        <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

        <figure>
          <img src="../images/project 2 bar.png" alt=""/>
          <figcaption>Complaints by Black and Hispanic people face significantly longer case lengths.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>(-2) The y-axis begins at 8.2 rather than 0, and is an unnoticable light gray color. This is a completely
            deceptive technique because it exagerrates difference between the groups.</li>
          <li>(-2) The bars for Asian, White, and American Indian are slightly less opaque to avert attention towards bars 
            for Black and Hispanic. This is completely deceptive because it attempts to direct the audience to focus on 
            the differences.</li>
          <li>(-2) Bars for Black and Hispanic are in the center of the graph. This is also completely deceptive for the same reason above.</li>
          <li>(1.5) Bars are narrow to emphasize height differences. Bar charts are typically good to help viewers easily
            compare them-- which I manipulated to persuade this proposition.</li>
          <li>(-2) Removed data about Refused, Other, and Unknown ethnicities to highlight difference. These data were
            actually close to the average investigation lengths for Black and Hispanic. Removing them allowed me to highlight
            a larger difference between the bars.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

        <figure>
          <img src="../images/project 2 pie.png" alt=""/>
          <figcaption>Complaints by people of all ethnicities face similar case lengths.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>(-2) Using a pie chart makes it difficult to assess differences-- each of the pieces all look the same size. 
            I considered using a bar chart or line plot instead but I figured the differences were too noticable.</li>
          <li>(-2) Rounds investigation length to the nearest month. 9 vs. 10 is such a small difference. I considered 
            rounding to the nearest tenth because it would seem more realistic but I also think that having whole numbers
            makes it easy to see the lack of difference.</li>
          <li>(1) Color scheme separates ethnicities-- it's easy to see that they all look the same. There are a lot of colors (8)
            so it might be difficult to process at first, but I think using this many colors also helps erase size differences
            between the pies.</li>
          <li>(2) Extra notes about how transformation ("average investigation length") was calculated. This is both an earnest
            and persuading feature because showing transparency builds trust between the audience and the graph.</li>
          <li>(2) Includes data about Refused, Other, and Unknown ethnicities to highlight equivalence. Showing all the data 
            groups also helps build trust. Some viewers may have not considered these data and be more likely to believe it.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

        <p>
          The overall design process was relatively straightforward for me. I knew that I wanted to create a bar plot but
          I did not consider using a pie chart until later on. Something that surprised me is that making earnest and deceptive
          graphs go through some of the same process. I knew that I had to incorporate some earnest techniques to make the 
          plot easy to understand-- easy enough to brush over the deception without realizing. Another thing I realized is 
          that both plots required some stretching of the truth. In the deceptive bar plot, not showing the entire y-axis 
          plays a key part in hiding the truth. However, while the pie chart does express the truth-- there is not much difference 
          in the average investigation lengths between ethnicities-- it also utilizes deception to exaggerate this truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          I now define "ethical analysis and visualization" as the ability to not just use earnest data science techniques, but 
          also be earnest in our intent. We must consider the information that our summaries and graphs hide, as long as false 
          realities they may create. It was really easy for me to manipulate my visualizations to be more persuasive, so it is 
          not hard to believe that those who create important visuals for the news might do the same. One bound I can draw to 
          distinguish "acceptable" vs. "misleading" persuasive choices is drawing proper axes that start at 0 and are evenly scaled. 
          This includes equivalence between the x and y-axes as well.
